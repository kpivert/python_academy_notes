# Instructions

This week, you learned about several more pandas methods. 

In this milestone, you'll group the data by state and then summarize the results to determine the top ten states with the highest COVID-related deaths.

To learn more about the variables contained in the data set, refer to the data dictionary: https://rsacdn.link/milestones/internal/python/covid/assets/covid_dictionary.html

# Milestone

```{python}
#| label: 'setup'
#| include: false

# Import your packages here
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import rcParams


# Set some options
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
rcParams.update({'savefig.bbox': 'tight'})
```

## Summarize data

In this milestone, you'll use groupwise summaries to compute the total values of `deaths` for each state and then plot the results for the states with the highest values.

## Recreation

### Part 1 - Import

Before you begin, you will need to import the `covid` data set:

1. Read the data from the data file `covid.csv`, which is stored in the `data/` folder in your working directory.
2. Save the data set to a variable named `covid`.

Work in the code chunk below:

```{python}
#| label: 'recreation-import'

covid = pd.read_csv('posit_academy/data/covid.csv')
```

### Part 2 - Compute total deaths

Run the code below to compute the total values of `deaths` for the state of New York.

```{python}
subset = covid.loc[covid['state'] == 'NY']
subset['deaths'].sum()
```

### Part 3 - Summarize data

Next, you'll compute the summary measure of total `deaths` for each state.

Run the code below to see a table.

```{python}
#| label: 'solution'
solution = pd.read_csv('posit_academy/data/milestone05.csv')
solution
```


Your task is to use what you've learned about functions and grouped summaries to transform `covid` into this table.

You will need to:

1. Group the data  by `state` using `.groupby()`
2. Summarize the total value of `cases` and `deaths` for each group
3. Use `.nlargest()` to find the top ten states with the highest total value of `deaths`

Work in the code chunk below. Save the result as `cases_deaths`. We will use the result in Part 4.

```{python}
#| label: 'recreation-summary'

cases_deaths = (
  covid
    .groupby('state')
    .agg({
      'cases': 'sum',
      'deaths': 'sum'
    })
    .reset_index()
    .nlargest(10, columns = 'deaths')
    .reset_index(drop = True)
)

```

Run the following code chunk to test whether your table matches the solution:

```{python}
#| label: 'compare'

# If your answer is correct, the comparison should return an empty DataFrame.
cases_deaths.reset_index(drop=True).compare(solution)
```

### Part 4 - Visualize it

Using the File Explorer on the left, navigate to the `images/` directory, then click on `milestone05.png` to open an image in the Editor pane. 

You should see a plot that displays the total deaths for the ten states with the highest values.

Use the new `cases_deaths` data to recreate the plot.

```{python}
#| label: 'recreation-visualize'

from plotnine import ggplot, aes, theme, geom_col, labs, coord_flip, theme_minimal

ggplot.show(
  ggplot(
    cases_deaths,
    aes( 
      'state', 
      'deaths' 
      )
    ) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(
      x = 'State',
      y = 'Deaths'
    )
)
```

## Extension

Using the code chunk below, investigate a research question about this data, using the additional data wrangling skills you learned this week. Some ideas:

1. Some states within the US coordinated their policies in response to the pandemic; do you see a regional or coalition-based pattern in `cases`, `deaths`, or other variables? Illustrate your findings with at least one graph.

2. Create both a table and a related graph for the 10 states with the _lowest_ reported values of `deaths`. Do you see any relationship between the `cases` and `deaths`in these states?

3. We have not yet explored the variable `tests`; what can you learn about the number of tests administered in different states? The relationship between tests and cases?

4. [any other research question of interest]

Alternately, working with a data set of your own, complete the following:

1. Read in your data
2. Use `.groupby()` and `.apply()` or `.agg()` to produce a summary table from your data 
3. Create a related graph of this data subset using plotnine


```{python}
#| label: 'extension'

cases_deaths_total = (
  covid
    .groupby('state')
    .agg({
      'cases': 'sum',
      'deaths': 'sum'
    })
    .reset_index()
)

cases_deaths_total['deaths_cases_ratio'] = cases_deaths_total['deaths'] / cases_deaths_total['cases']

```

```{python}

# cases_deaths_total.sort_values(by = 'deaths_cases_ratio', ascending = False)

ggplot.show(
  ggplot(
    cases_deaths_total.nlargest(n = 10, columns = 'deaths_cases_ratio'),
    aes(
      x = 'reorder(state, deaths_cases_ratio)',
      y = 'deaths_cases_ratio'
    )
  ) +
  geom_col(
    width = 0.5,
    fill = "#00468b"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = '',
    y = 'Ratio of Deaths to Cases',
    title = 'Highest Ratio of Deaths to Cases by State'
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
)
```


```{python}

ggplot.show(
  ggplot(
    cases_deaths_total.nsmallest(n = 10, columns = 'deaths_cases_ratio'),
    aes(
      x = 'reorder(state, deaths_cases_ratio)',
      y = 'deaths_cases_ratio'
    )
  ) +
  geom_col(
    width = 0.5,
    fill = "#ff8200"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = '',
    y = 'Ratio of Deaths to Cases',
    title = 'Lowest Ratio of Deaths to Cases by State'
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
)
```

```{python}

from great_tables import GT

ten_lowest_deaths = (
  cases_deaths_total
    .nsmallest(n = 10, columns = 'deaths')
    .sort_values(by = 'deaths', ascending = False)
    .round(decimals=3)
)

(
  GT(ten_lowest_deaths)
    .fmt_number(
      columns = ['deaths_cases_ratio'],
      decimals = 3
    )
    .fmt_number(
      columns = ['cases', 'deaths'], 
      decimals = 0
    )
    .cols_label({
      'state': 'State',
      'cases': 'Cases',
      'deaths': 'Deaths',
      'deaths_cases_ratio': 'Deaths/Cases Ratio'
    })  
)
```


```{python}
ggplot.show(
  ggplot(
    ten_lowest_deaths,
    aes(
      x = 'reorder(state, deaths)',
      y = 'deaths'
    )
  ) +
  geom_col(
    width = 0.5,
    color = '#000'
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = '',
    y = 'Deaths',
    title = 'Lowest Number of Deaths by State'
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
)
```


```{python}

test_cases = (
  covid
    .groupby('state')
    .agg({
      'cases': 'sum',
      'tests': 'sum'
    })
    .reset_index()
)

test_cases['cases_tests_ratio'] = test_cases['tests'] / test_cases['cases']

test_cases.nlargest(n = 10, columns='cases_tests_ratio')
```
