# Welcome

Welcome to your Posit Academy project! This folder contains materials for analyzing COVID-19 data from the COVID Tracking Project using Python.

## Project Structure

- **Quarto Documents (.qmd files)**: These are the milestone files where you'll complete your work:
  - Files are numbered 01-05 in sequence, building skills progressively
  - Each milestone introduces new Python data science techniques
  - You will complete milestone recreations and extensions within these files to advance through the project

- **data/**: Contains the COVID-19 datasets you'll analyze
  - Main files: `covid.csv`, `covid_state_pop.csv`, `covid_dates_split.csv`
  - Milestone "solution" datasets for you to compare against your work

- **assets/**: Contains data dictionaries explaining the variables in each dataset

- **images/**: Contains milestone "solution" images for you to compare against your work

## Getting Started

**Step 1**: Install Python packages you will need for this project:

1. Open your Terminal tab (just to to right of your Console tab).
2. Run `uv sync` in your Terminal (this may take several minutes to complete)

Note: `uv sync` uses uv, a popular Python package manager, to install Python packages included in the `uv.lock` file. You will see output in the Console indicating that Python packages are being installed. Wait for this to complete before proceeding.

**Step 2**: Open your first milestone file.

1. In the Explorer tab on the left, open the file `covid_01_quarto_python-basics.qmd`
2. Follow the instructions in this file to complete the exercises
